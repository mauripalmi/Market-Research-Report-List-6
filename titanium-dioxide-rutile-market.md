<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Titanium Dioxide Rutile Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulphate Process</li><li>Chlorination Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The titanium dioxide rutile market comprises two primary production processes: the sulfate process and the chlorination process. The sulfate process involves the reaction of titanium ores with sulfuric acid, yielding a titanyl sulfate solution that is further processed to produce rutile. In contrast, the chlorination process uses chlorine to convert titanium ores into titanium tetrachloride, which is then transformed into rutile through thermal reduction. Each method offers distinct advantages in terms of cost, purity, and environmental impact, influencing market dynamics.</p></p>
