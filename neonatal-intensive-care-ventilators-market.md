<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Intensive Care Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Neonatal Intensive Care Ventilators market comprises two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves intubation, where a breathing tube is inserted into the trachea, allowing for direct airflow and precise control over breathing patterns. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, utilizes methods like CPAP or nasal cannulas, delivering support without the need for intubation, reducing the risk of complications. Both types are crucial for managing respiratory distress in neonates, catering to varying clinical needs.</p></p>
