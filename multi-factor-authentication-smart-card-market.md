<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-Factor Authentication Smart Card Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Multi-Factor Authentication Smart Card market is divided into two main types: contact and contactless. Contact smart cards require physical contact with a reader to authenticate, providing a secure method by relying on embedded chips and PINs or biometrics. In contrast, contactless smart cards utilize RFID technology, enabling users to authenticate by simply waving the card near a reader, enhancing convenience and speed. Both types bolster security by combining something the user has (the card) with another factor, like a password.</p></p>
